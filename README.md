# Design-Principles

The most important design principles are named as SOLID by Robert C. Martin(aka Uncle bob) in 2004 while working with Michael Feathers.
The SOLID principles tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected. The goal of the principles is the creation of mid-level softwares structure(Just above the level of code) that:

1) Tolerate change,
2) Are easy to understand, and
3) Are the basis of components that can be used in many software systems.

I discuss each principle briefly and provide the code in C++ to realize the concept.
